# FABLE (Factor Analysis with the BLEssing of dimensionality)

R package to implement Factor Analysis with BLEssing of dimensionality (FABLE) approach. 
Provides posterior samples of the covariance matrix modeled using factor analysis, along with providing posterior mean (without carrying out sampling).

All results in the paper can be replicated with scripts in `extras/replicationCodes` .
